# Countries-App
Individual project.
An application helps to find the main key information about a selected country (the capital, population, national languages, currency, etc). It was implemented with the usage of various tech stacks. However, the main emphasis was made on the usage of TypeScript, which helps to avoid up to 90% of possible errors in the pre-deployment stage.


## Tech stack
+ React, 
+ Typescript,
+ Redux,
+ Material-UI, 
+ REST API.
